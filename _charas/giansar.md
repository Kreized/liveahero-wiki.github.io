    The knife-shaped parallel weapon collects and analyzes information about the target it stabs and reproduces their appearance in his own suit.
  
    Its reproduction accuracy is very high, but the target is limited to heroes and the acquired information cannot be stocked.
  
    If he wants to mimic another hero, he will have to deactivate his ability and re-analyze them.
  
    Although exercising his abilities at high frequencies will cause a decrease in reproduction accuracy, the informationized space, for example,
    the hyper-virtual reality world is a good match for his parallel weapons, and his hacking abilities will also give him an advantage.
  BIO_H02: |-
    He used to be a promising top student candidate, but one day while being an intern at a big hero company, he came to be embroiled in a certain incident.
  
    As a result, he was judged to not have a hero quality, and was not able to obtain a hero license.
  
    In the midst of the disappointment and pain of not being a hero and being put on probation as a dangerous person, he makes a vow.
  
    He will become the strongest hero, with information over all heroes, a real hero that he always admire and long to be.

  BIO_S01: |-
    With a deep and highly technical knowledge of various systems, both software and hardware, Giansar is very meticulous in contrast to his rough tone and demeanor.
  
    He likes to use words such as perfect and exact to describe his plans, and he is very much against any element of uncertainty.
  
    He has strong opposition against heroes, and it seems to come from his past attempt to obtain a hero license.
